Notes:
--
sic deleted everytime it appeared in parentheses and italics
--all capital "J"s changed to "I"s in the transcription, for clarity.
RWD: The printer didn't add periods in a number of places and a later reader duly added a little
slash; I've tried to catch a lot of these, but if you find a missing period where a sentence seems
to be ending, add it in.
