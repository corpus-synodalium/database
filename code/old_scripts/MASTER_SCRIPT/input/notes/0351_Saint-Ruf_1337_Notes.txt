Problems or Queries: 
Numbering/section breaks differs between editions. Followed section breaks from Giraud; consistent with Albanes until section 56.
Many of the passages in the Albanes edition simply cite another text and then indicate variants (e.g. cc. 1-5); in this case, full text is copied from the Giraud edition instead

[2] Albanes gives abominabilis; Giraud gives abliomitialis 
[3] MS has cujuscunqu
